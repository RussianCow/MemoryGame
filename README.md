### Memory Game

To run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

and open a browser window to http://localhost:9010/.

#### Potential TODOs

These are things that I would do in the real world with more time. In no particular order:

* Add animations for the card flips
* Add tests for the React components
    * Make sure that the right things are being rendered at each stage
    * Make sure that the right Redux actions are being dispatched properly
* Make the game more responsive and mobile-friendly
